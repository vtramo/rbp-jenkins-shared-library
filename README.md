# RBP Jenkins Shared Library

This library offers a Jenkins Shared Library designed to facilitate Continuous Integration (CI) and
Continuous Deployment (CD) processes within Jenkins specifically for the 
[Restful Booker Platform](https://github.com/vtramo/restful-booker-platform) (RBP) project.
Its main aim is to eliminate code redundancy and abstract common patterns prevalent in the pipeline.
